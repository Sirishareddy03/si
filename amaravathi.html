  <p><i>Amaravati (English: /əməˈrɑːvəti/) is the capital of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.[a] It is located on the banks of the river Krishna in Guntur district.

    Dharanikota, the ancient city site nearby, was founded more than 2,200 years ago, serving as an ancient capital.[9] The Amaravati Stupa was an important Buddhist site of pilgrimage and holy learning. Under the British Raj, many ancient Buddhist sculptures were taken to other museums in India and Britain.
    
    The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone at a ceremonial event in Uddandarayunipalem village on 22 October 2015.[10]
    
    The office of the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh has operated from Velagapudi since April 2016. The Andhra Pradesh Legislature remained in Hyderabad until March 2017, when it was relocated to newly constructed interim legislative buildings in Velagapudi.</i></p>

  <p>Dhyana Buddha Statue is a gigantic statue of Lord Buddha in Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh. Known to be among the tallest Buddha statues in India, With a towering height of 125 feet, Dhyana Buddha Statue was commissioned in 2003 and was completed in 2015. The status sits facing the pristine River Krishna and sprawls over a humongous green space covering 4.5 acres of land.

    Dhyana Buddha Statue was sculpted by R. Mallikarjuna Rao, the Joint Director of Social Welfare, Guntur. The design is inspired by over 50 sculptures’ designs from over 145 sites. In addition to that, Dhyana Buddha Park was built around the statue where people can visit and relax. Besides, the complex also houses a seminar hall and 20 luxury suites for Buddhist tourists visiting from all over the world.</p>
    <p>The recorded history of Amaravati and nearby Dharanikota dates to the 5th century BC. It was the capital of Satavahanas who ruled from the 3rd century BC to 3rd century AD who also patronized Buddhism along with Hinduism. The most important historic monument in Amaravathi town is the Mahachaitya. It is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India which maintains a site museum known as old museum.

        The project was conceived by R. Mallikarjuna Rao in 2002, who was then serving as the Deputy Director, Social Welfare Department in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. Mallikarjuna Rao was inspired by the magnificence of the Amaravati School of Art which flourished in the region circa 200 BC – 200 AD and wanted to recreate it. The Guntur district administration provided 4.5 acre of land and the construction work began in 2003–04. The funds for the project were provided by the Andhra Pradesh state government, Guntur district administration, Dalai Lama, Tourism Department, Kalachakra organisers Norbulingka, and also from the sale of greeting cards and paintings done by Mallikarjuna Rao. The Department of Tourism took over the project in 2007. The construction was completed in 2015</p>

    <p>Amareswara Temple located in Amaravathi is devoted to Lord Shiva, the 'Destroyer of the Universe'. The holy place embraces a 15 ft high marble Shiv Ling. It is believed that Lord Shiva is present in the structure of five lingams - Pranaveswara, Agasteswara, Kosaleswara, Someswara and Parthiveswara.

        Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, Amareswara Temple has a lot of myths behind its creation. 'Maha Shivaratri' of 'Magha Bahula Dasami' is the main festival celebrated in a big way here. This holy place has a divine aura that seeps into the heart, mind and body of all patrons. An interesting fact about the Amareswara Temple is that it is situated at a point where the river alters its route.</p>
        <p>Vasireddy Venkatadri Naidu, King of Chintapalli and later Dharanikota, was a great devotee of Amareswara. He expanded and renovated the temple. The popular legend has it that once during the course of putting down a rebellion in his land the King had to have recourse to a massacre of the Chenchus, whereupon he lost his mental peace, which he regained only when he came to Amaravati. He shifted his place from Chintapalli to Amaravati in 1796, and devoted his entire life, time and revenues to building temples for Lord Siva. He renovated the Amareswaraswamy temple here, engaged nine learned archakas for the daily archana of the Lord, and provided them with all the needs of livelihood, including 12 acres (49,000 m2) of land to each. The temple as it stands owes much to him.[citation needed]

            As per Legend, the demon king named Tarakasura defeated the gods after being awarded a boon by Lord Shiva. Shiva vowed to kill the demons and hence the gods came to reside here and since then the place came to be called Amaravati. Lord Shiva is worshipped as Amareswara with his consort Bala Chamundika, who is considered as the fourth of the 18 goddesses.[2] srikrishnadevaraya had visited this temple after the war of kodapalli</p>

            <p>Amaravati Stupa is a heritage monument, and ancient Buddhist stupa located in the Amaravathi. The memorial is currently under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India. Popularly known as the Mahachaitya, Deepaladinne or the Great Stupa of Amaravati, this is among the largest stupas in India and one of the most visited sites in Amaravati.

                Built in the phases between the 3rd century BCE and 250 CE, The premises also have an Archaeological Museum other than the stupa itself. Amaravathi Stupa built by a representative of Emperor Ashoka, the monument is constructed of brick and has a circular vedika which houses Lord Buddha in a human form seated over an elephant.</p>
            <p>It was discovered and made famous by Colonel Colin Mackenzie in 1797. After its discovery, several European officia showed interest in the sculptures found at the site and even tried to excavate the structure. The lowest stratum of excavations here revealed black and red ware and northern black polished ware, hinting at the age of the stupa. The excavations also yielded stone tools, dating the mahachaitya sites back to prehistoric times.The sculptures that were excavated at the mahachaitya were displayed in the Madras Museum and British Museum in London.

                Amaravati's recorded history can be dated back to the time of Mauryan emperor Asoka. Asoka's thirteenth rock edict mentions Andhra and hints at this particular mahachaitya's existence.</p>

These artefacts belong to the period 3rd century BC to 12th century AD exhibit in three different galleries. The ancient and complex art work done by the craftsmen of that period are displayed in the first gallery. The Purnakumbha designs and the Lotus designs here express the intricate art of those days. The two drums of slab depicting the Stupas, Swastika mark on the cushioned seat of the throne under the Bodhi tree, the Agni Skanda (Flaming pillar), the dome and the standing Buddha belonging to 8th century are the precious collections of this museum.
