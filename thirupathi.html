   <p>The waters of Talakona are enriched with herbs and people believe that it has healing properties. A long and treacherous trekking route leads to the top of the hill, which can be reached by multiple paths. Talakona hills geographically is considered a part of the Eastern Ghats.

    There is a beautiful waterfall falling deep into the valley from a cliff on the upper reaches. According to the local residents, it is said that the origin of water is difficult to be traced out since an underground stream surfaces here.
    
    There used to be a 240 meter long canopy rope walk, about 35 to 40 feet in height . There are number of trek routes in different categories of difficulty, giving an option for the visitor to choose their route.
    
    In the area there is an ancient Siva temple which is flooded with devotees during Sivarathri festival. There are also deep caves scattered over the mountains where it is believed that sages meditate eternally. A stream flows near the canopy walk area where a bathing ghat is under construction.
    
    Accommodation is also available in this dense forest</p>
    <p>The Temple at Talakona water falls is a Siva Temple known as "SIDDHESWARA SWAMY TEMPLE". The deity is called as 'Siddheswara'. As per the Local people, the temple was built some 140 years ago.The SIVA LINGA in the temple was brought from the ruined temple of Rayavaripalli, a village in Pulicherla Mandal, On olden days there was a custom that if any new temple is constructed, instead of making a new Siva Linga, can install old one which lies without Pooja in ruined Temples. Based on this custom the SIVA LINGA was brought from Rayavaripalli ruined temple. The relics of the ruined temple can be seen today also in the agricultural fields of Rayavaripalli. That field is called as " Lingaakaaram kaada kayya", till today, which means a piece of agricultural field near Siva Lingam</p>

    <p>Natural Arch, Tirumala hills, a notified National Geo-heritage Monument,is a distinctive geological feature 1 km (0.6 mi) north of the Tirumala hills temple, near the Chakra Teertham in Tirupati district in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The arch is also called Silathoranam  in the local language (Telugu language: sila means ‘rock’ and thoranam means a garland strung over a threshold, connecting two vertical columns or an ‘arch’ as in this case). The arch measures 8 m (26.2 ft) in width and 3 m (9.8 ft) in height, and is naturally formed in the quartzites of Cuddapah Supergroup of Middle to Upper Proterozoic (1600 to 570 Ma) due to natural erosive forces</p>
    <p>In the 1980s, during excavations for a geological fault in the Tirumala hills, geologists found this rare geological formation of the rock arch which has two dissimilar sets of rocks with a connecting thin link. The assessed geological age of the rock arch is 2.5 million years. Formation of the arch is attributed to intensified weathering and erosion of stream action that has withstood the torque of nature.[10] This is a rare geological fault which is technically called in the geological idiom as ‘Eparchaean Unconformity’. At this location, the boundary is between sedimentary rocks of the Cudappah Supergroup, 1600 million years in age, and Archaean rocks comprising granites, gneisses and dolerite dykes that are more than 2100 million years old. This unconformity gives an indication of the enormous time gap in the creation of the earth's crust</p>

                <p>Sri Venkateswara National Park is a national park and biosphere reserve in Tirupati of Andhra Pradesh, India. The total area of the park is 353 km2. The park is known for its many waterfalls, including the Talakona, Gundalakona and Gunjana. As the government of India declared the Seshachalam Hills as one of the biosphere reserves of India in 2010, this national park becomes the part of it.The key threats the national park are construction and quarrying. The Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project, is undertaking the upgrade of highways in the state of Andhra Pradesh, and this includes construction of Warangal-Pollacolu road, which passes close to the western boundary of the national park. Another construction is of the Kapil Teertham Dam inside the national park by the Andhra Pradesh Government and the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam. Both these construction projects raise concerns over the potential impact of the road and the dam on the habitat and the wildlife in the sanctuary. Regular forest fires are also a constant threat to the biodiversity and ecological balance in the park.</p>
                <p>About 178 species of birds from this national park have been identified. The globally threatened yellow-throated bulbul is seen here. grey-fronted green pigeon, a bird of the Himalayas and the Western Ghats is quite common in these forests. The critically endangered Oriental white-backed vulture is found in the national park. Some of the other birds found here are:

                    large hawk-cuckoo, blue-faced malkoha, yellow-browed bulbul, Indian scimitar-babbler and Loten's sunbird.
                    
                    In 1984 the Asian elephant, not seen in Andhra Pradesh for nearly 300 years, re-appeared in the southern part of Chittoor district. In 1993, a breakaway herd of five individuals moved to the Chamala Valley of Tirumala forests in this national park.
                    
                    Among predators the leopard is quite common, along with the wild dog. Other predators include golden jackal, Indian fox, small Indian civet and jungle cat. Sloth bear is frequently encountered. Sambar, spotted deer, mouse deer, barking deer, four-horned antelope and wild boar are the main ungulates. The nocturnal slender loris could be common but is seldom seen. The Indian giant squirrel and tree shrew are other interesting species.
                    
                    Among reptiles, the most interesting species is the gliding lizard, found in some deep forested valleys. Another important reptile of this national park is the Indian golden gecko. Originally reported from rocky ravines in the Eastern Ghats, the Indian golden gecko was rediscovered from the same area in 1985

                    <p>Popularly known as Tirupati Balaji Temple, the Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati dates back to 800 AD and is one of the wealthiest Tirupati temples of the world. Resting peacefully on the seventh peak of Tirumala Hills, just to the north of the flowing Sri Swami Pushkarini River, this temple is visited by thousands of pilgrims every day. This temple was built in commemoration of Lord Venkateswara. Believed to be an incarnation of Hindu god Vishnu, Lord Venkateswara took birth on Earth to destroy evil and restore peace and harmony. To date, his effigy stands inside the temple complex, and it is said it will remain there during the entire period of quarrel and disharmony, the Kali Yuga.

                        A silvery facade greets the eye as one enters the complex. Constructed in ancient Dravidian style, the architecture of this temple is composed of intricate carvings all over the walls. The temple has another entrance that is painted golden, a complete contrast to the main silver entrance. Pilgrims coming from all walks of life pay their homage to Lord Venkateswara by singing hymns and chanting prayers. The blessings of God are offered in the form of food known as prasad. The temple is illuminated with lights and candles on grand festivals and is revered as one of the most magnificently built temples in Tirupati.

                        <p>The first recorded endowment was made by Pallava queen Samavai in the year 966 CE. She donated many jewels and two parcels of land (one 10 acres and other 13 acres) and ordered to use the revenues generated from that land for the celebration of major festivals in the temple.[13] The Pallava dynasty (9th century), the Chola dynasty (10th century), and Vijayanagara pradhans (14th and 15th centuries) were committed devotees of Venkateswara. The temple gained most of its current wealth and size under the Vijayanagara Empire, present-day Karnataka state, with the donation of diamonds and gold.[14] In 16th century, Vijayanagara Emperor Krishnadevaraya was a frequent donor and visitor to the temple. His donations of gold and jewels enabled the Ananda Nilayam (inner shrine) roofing to be gilded. On 2 January 1517, Krishnadevaraya installed his own statue in the temple.[15]

                            After the decline of Vijayanagara Empire, rulers from states such as the Kingdom of Mysore and the Gadwal Samsthanam worshipped as pilgrims and donated ornaments and valuables to the temple.[citation needed] Maratha general Raghoji I Bhonsle (died 1755) visited the temple and set up a permanent administration for the conduct of worship in the temple.[citation needed][16] Between 1320 CE and 1369 CE, idols of Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam were brought to this temple for safe keeping.</p>
