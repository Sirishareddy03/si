    <p><i>Visakhapatnam's history stretches back to the 6th century BCE and the city finds mention in ancient texts such as the 4th century BCE writings of Pāṇini and Katyayana. Historically considered part of the Kalinga region,[26][27] it was ruled by the Vengi kingdom and the Pallava and Eastern Ganga dynasties during medieval times.[23] Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the Chola dynasty king Kulothunga I. Control over the city fluctuated between the Chola dynasty of Tamil Nadu and the Gajapati Kingdom of Odisha[26][27] until its conquest by the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century.[23] European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under French rule at the end of the 18th century</i></p>

    <p>For history lovers, Borra caves are one of the best places to visit in Visakhapatnam. Set amidst the Ananthagiri Hills in Araku Valley, it is considered to be one of the largest caves in the country and is located at an elevation of about 705 meters. The caves were discovered way back in 1807, and ever since, they’ve become a popular tourist attraction. Made of karstic limestone, travellers can witness the real beauty of these structures when the natural skylight paves its way in. Being kaleidoscopic in nature, tourists can also admire the enigmatic beauty of evergreen forests, scenic landscape, and the breathtaking views that surround the Borra caves.</p>
    <p>On the discovery of the caves, there are several legends, which the tribals (Jatapu, Porja, Kondadora, Nookadora, valmiki etc.[4]) who inhabit the villages around the caves narrate. The popular legend is that a cow, grazing on the top of the caves, dropped 60 m (200 ft) through a hole in the roof. The cowherd while searching for the cow came across the caves. He found a stone inside the cave that resembled a Lingam, which he interpreted as the Lord Shiva who protected the cow. The village folk who heard the story believed it and since then they have built a small temple for Lord Shiva outside the cave. People flock to the temple for worship and the cave to get a glimpse of the Lingam.[6]

Another lyrical legend is that the Shiva Lingam representing the Hindu God Lord Shiva, is found deep in the caves and above which is a stone formation of a cow (Sanskrit: Kamadhenu). It is surmised that the udder of this cow is the source of the Gosthani (Sanskrit: Cow's udder) River which originates from here, flows through Vizianagram and Visakhapatnam districts before emptying into the Bay of Bengal near Bheemunipatnam.</p>
